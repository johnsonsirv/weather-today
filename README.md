# Weather Widget
[Weather Widget](https://js-weather-widget.netlify.com/) is a simple weather app that explores how to work with APIs in JavaScript. It demonstrates the knowledge of ``asynchronous`` workflow through the use of ``Promises``, ``Async & Await``, and ``JSON`` to serve data from a remote API.

It contains basic features such as -
1. Search the current weather in a desired City
2. Show a default weather location for the city of ``Lagos``

This project was completed in line with standards provided by [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
